- Little Heavy Mobile should light weighted .   Those days gone when bulky  is good .  
- Outdated Think this is the model of 2010 when no one make touch screen and no one have those facility but now a days if  you spend 30K you will get far better and  Larger screen  with all the features .  
- Camara 8 MP when now u can get 13 to 20 MP in front and Front 5 MP .   One thing should remember dont mix with 10k   price camara .   You can't compare COW vs  Dog .  Compare with Moto G Lumia 730 atleast .  
- Why maintenance is tooooo much costly .   When u visit store for maintenance after warranty you are finished  ! ! !
- Not a good product  .  I have purchased i 5s .   But there is a problem with the mobile if i call someone i am hearing lot  of disturbance in the mobile but if i put  it in loudspeaker mode it working fine no issues
- Very Heat and not satisfied
- Camera and Torch Light does not work properly
- pathetic  .  very bad  .   i have used it for several months .   most features bad .   hangs very often .   Battery is horrible .  
- Very slow low battery .  It comes with iOS 9 or latest iOS because of that you will feel lags while operating .   .   low  battery if you are on 3G
- Please do not buy this i  .  I'm hugely disappointed with this i as the battery hardly lasts an hour and also the  speaker sometimes makes strange noises
- I 5SThe product turned out to have EXTREMELY/ABYSMALLY low battery life .   I have to charge the same at least three  times a day and have to constantly carry a  power pack with me .  
- not good .   heating problemless ramless internal spacenot a full hd display low resolution camera picture quality far  below from a digital camera screen size is  also less
- Charger quelty is poor  .  i have open box and put charge  suddenly charge blast spark all wire of charge is  removed from charger so Luke  is safe but  charger lost .   there is no any issue at my home wiring other  charge  ok after that also
- Guys be careful this device doesn't support 4G though it is 5s .  Our assumption is all i 5s does support 4G
- worst mobile ever only having good build quality .  worst front camera when compared to xiaomi Mi4 u can compare it by  yourself .   .  Only brand name that too going to  disappear soon due to so called 'nothing new' so called apple now .   .   .   .  
- not worth the money .   .   .  Go for i6 if u need an apple 
- Worst Expericence  .  After 2 months of usage it started rebooting problem and suddenly got dead .  
- Very worst scenario .  The initial screen is flickering .   The boot up is not working properly it is not going to the next  step after the initial settings .   I have tried  with multiple proper SIM cards all were failed to launch the mobile .   Very  worst scenario :(  .  Was this product not tested at all .   .   .   .   very very unfair not at all  acceptable
- copy of samsung s4 and s3 micromaxcanvas knight is best than this micromax 350 cost just 9 k i 5 s very high cost   if u wait 1 more month it will be half of  this rate the rate when i released is 60 kand now it 20 k
- Apple repair service is very bad in India .  My i 5s having battery drain and excessive heating issue .   And Apple is not  repairing it .   Still it is in warranty .  Every  time they ask me to factory reset my i .   But it did not resolve it .  
- Dont Buy This  .   .   .    ! ! BEWARE  ! !very bad experience .   .   .   .   ! ! worst  ever .   .   .  
 very slow processing speed .   .   .   .   camera quality is good but not up to the mark .   .   .   .   ! !front camera gives blury images .   .   .   .  very  small screen
- Battery drain with in 4 hours of full charge and it heated up very fast 
- Installed only 3 apps so far and it hangs giving a very bad touch usage experience 
- Shit  From BULLSHIT APPLE Friends don't buy this bullshit  .  SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 is much much better than this  shit .   .  Infact NOTE 2 have much more features  than this .  AND IN LESS PRICE .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  
- Pathetic battery .  6 months later battery drains fully in 4 hours and  heats up even when not used .   not worth the  price paid
- bad experience Not working Freezing issue twice a day
- Worst experience Purchased I 5s 16 GB and found Micro is not working
- Heating and battery drain issues full heating issue even not able to hold the mobile during video call and battery  drained from 95% to 40% in 40 min video call
- S stands for Shit For this kind of money I can buy the best stylus  more powerful and feature proof .   It's  prehistoric icons uncustomizable screens paid  apps non removable battery lack of expandable memory are a dead turn  off .  
- less battry back up and its getting heat very soon .  I bought my i 5s but am not satisfied with this very less batry  back up and i dont knw its becoming too  heat if i play game for 5 mins .  This is too pathetic .   .  
- waste apple mobile  .  it is the waste  ever .  in the  sensor only good  .  my  apple finger print was sensor was  gone quikly so  .   the look is only good  .    because of look and name of the company only it was getting by others .   so dont  buy this  .  if we compair to moto g the moto g is good the price also perfect
- worst people are telling note 3 with all its massive specs as a shit becouse of its price .   but this mobile with 16 gb  memory costs more than note 3 as good never  buy a apple phne
- Apple has been crazy but didn't think this bad .   .   .   .  At this price i would get much much better  like the note 3 .   .   .   .    even the galaxy s4 is better than this even  though it is older All flagship models of android OEMs are better than  this .   .   .   .  
- FOOLS aND IDIOTS BUY aPPLE S OTHERS BUY NOKIa  LG  OR KaRBONN .   BEaCUSE SCREEN ND BaCK SIDE GETS BROKEN IF aNY  I FaLLS DOWN .   NO aPPS SMaLL  FOR 40K .    NO USE FOR REGULR PHN USERS COS NTNG IN THIS  LIKE aPPS  GOOD  BUILD OR ETC .   BUY LUMIa OR LG G2
- WORST CELL  OUT THERE SERVICE INCOMPETENT  .  he i is horrible .   They have incompetent service personnel their  executive department has no authority to do  anything and EVERY update creates problems the  did not previously have  yet never fixes the KNOWN problems they acknowledge .  
- The Apple UI is so hard to use and the battery drains like there's no tomorrow even on full charge .   The only thing  that's good is the aesthetics .   They probably   made the  so thin they couldn't fit in 1 gb of ram and a decent  processor .   You can't even expand the memory .  At least you can get better processors more RAM  more storage space and expadability/connectivity options with Android s .  
- Overhyped Overrated Overpriced .  Ok I didn't buy this  .   It's a prize from a friend of mine .   After comparing this  to my Galaxy Note II everything that  exists in this  also exists in My Note II .   Even my Note II have much more features .   People say this is the best  but it's just a gimmick & hype .   I can't  even customize the home screen like my Note II .   The UI is as simple as usual just a boring grid of icons  .   As you know no widgets here it's pretty boring for a  person who always want speed & ease like me .   I don't want to open the mail app just for checking my email it can be done faster & easier with widgets .   The maps app  sucks the map of my country isn't complete .   Luckily I can download Google Maps from the app store .   The signal & the speaker are weak .   The proximity sensor behave  weirdly .   G sensor is not sensitive .   I can't transfer music via bluetooth .   Why do you buy i if there are many smarts that are better & cheaper than the  i?

- The  heats up like anything .   It's very dangerous flaw .   When it starts getting heat up then it is  so hot that I get scared .   Really disappointed with my purchase  as it seemed to be like a faulty product .  
- Screen resolution not good compared to other is .  
- The body becomes hot and the  hangs if i open any app .   It has hanged more than 4 rimes in less than a month .   Is it s problem or software because not  everyone is having the issue .   The  seems to be a defective piece sold online so that no one comes to know and the return is also tricky .  
- The i 5S has very poor connectivity .   I have another apple device and both the s on same network show different signal strength making the 5S very poor .  
- This i 5s voice and Touch ID is defective .   Cannot hear anything when I call someone or when I receive a call and Touch ID does not function smoothly .

- The  was too slow and the charger wasn't working .  
- The worst as ever .   The i 5s 16GB is getting heated like anything i ordered twice .   The same problem persists both times .   Don?t buy from cloudtail its worst .   fully  disappointed .  
- Poor product .   The sleep or wake button is not working .   I went to the imagine service center there they said they will replace a new mobile .   It?s better to buy in  stores itself .  
- overall I?m not happy with the product started getting hanged and device gets heated up went to service centre in first month itself .  
- My experience is quite disheartening At first I received a damaged instrument The caller is not able to hear when I speak I hv to put on th speaker or plug in th  ear to speak I didn?t want to exchange as there r experiences of others who did not receive the refund I do not have the time either to pursue it either .

- It's been 6 month's using the  and each day is full of troubles .   Can't hear at times person the other side can't hear me .   .   .   .  cannot return the product  now .   .   .   .  it's a mess ! ! Guys please be very sure of buying such costly stuff especially if a sale kind of thing is on .  
- I purchased i  5s in Sep'14 .   Now in Dec'14 it stopped working .   This hangs at any time while it has more than 9 GB memory left .   Now this completely switched off .    Don?t know why .   Need to go service centre .   I want to switch over to either HTC or Sony now .  
- Very bad product dint work good for one day also it is now there in service centre  .  I wasted my valuable money on this piece this is second time i have received  faulty item from amazon .  
- I am using this product from 8 months within 8 months device getting hang Battery backup was worst while doing charging device getting heat .  
- My i Bluetooth is not working I have checked week back I restarted and check still it?s not working .  
- Really pathetic service I got a faulty handset I went to service centre but it won't accept by service people .  
- I received this  on the 24/5/2015 .   I was very excited but just after 3 days of usage the  is overheating very quickly and in app sounds have just  disappeared .   There is no volume in any of apps but the ringtone and everything are still working .   It's overall a superb  by apple but something faulty with the  retailer maybe .   I would still recommend this  but maybe not from Cloudtail .  
- Received my i 5s on Dec 21st .   The upper part of the screen has the yellowish tint and also getting heated up on charging .   Shown to the Apple service centre .   I  did not expect such issues at all on the 1st day of 5s ownership .   Will have to return the product if Apple service centre does not replace the handset .  
- It?s been 28 hours I brought this i 5s .   Its get extremely hot while using browser and while charging as well .  
- Facing issue with  keys are getting press automatically feeling irritated auto switching to another pages here & there .  
- Battery life is very disappointing .   In 4G mode with minimal to no use the battery would last for half a day .   In 3G mode with minimal use it will last a day .   I had  moved from Samsung because of its battery life but not a great move .   Otherwise rest of the performance is satisfactory not super extraordinary .   One thing which was  far better than Samsung was i doesn't hang at all .  
- can find a gap between the front screen n the aluminium body at the right top corner of i 5s tat i purchased 2 days back is it normal .   When pressed the screen it  flexes in .   Will anything happen to it in future .   
- didn't like the i 5S as a product .   .   .   there are no improvement on camera side when we compare to 4S .   I would like to return this  to amazon and by any good  android  for my personal use .   Please let me know how I can return this product even I crossed the no of days as written in return policy .  
- Total waste of money .   Amazon sold me a defective piece wherein the  is getting hung since the first day .   I need a replacement at the earliest with the original   .   
- As i got my  3 days back I?m facing problem with the camera .   There is a wave like line on screen when using camera in video mode .  
-  gets heated too much .  
-  is working fine but the lock button is wobbly even the volume buttons are pretty loose too .  
- Battery backup is very less and the  overheats frequently even if it is in sleep .  
- It is not operating friendly and  gets continue hanged with the update of ios8 .  
- Very very small battery life and Internet not working only 1715 mah battery .  
- Charger and  both are heating up and apple support is not able to figure out .   I am working with them and hoping that they will provide the solution but at this  point I am not happy with it as you don't want this after spending so much money .  
- I am not happy with the performance .  it frequently getting hanged which is very unusual in i .   Screen gets blurred at least twice every day .   I need to restart  every time it happens .   I doubt the genuinity of the product I received .  
- In was expecting a  worth of 35K not having issues like touch screen issue delay in response time etc .   really disappointed with the  and with seller .  
- This  used to get heated very quickly and more over the voice quality isn't that great .  
- There was a signal issue with this  like anywhere i was irrespective of inside or outdoor I had only 3 dots and it never went full anytime I tested this for  3- 4 days .   Then when I took it to the service station they told it?s better to return it .   Then I did so .  
- I 5s is outdated as compare to its competitor .   it?s not good as per todays gadgets .   guys buy some other  .  
- The item is not upto the mark .   I used a moto g 1st gen mobile which i feel had a greater signal (Wi- Fi or mobile network) reception than this i .   This also heats  up fast when charging .   The battery backup is pathetic .   Sometimes the music stops in between and you need to restart the  to trigger it again .   I wonder if this is  a new i or a refurbished one .  
- After working fine for few days .    started to hang on to camera app .   WhatsApp is not working smoothly pics are taking too much time and uploading getting failed  also .   Something is wrong .   Talked to Amazon customer care .   .   As now 10 days are over so I need to visit apple store .   Hopefully they will the accept product as genuine  and do the needful .  
- Nothing can match android .   Bit disappointed with the  .   .   Anybody planning to buy this there are many other options in android .   Apps are very old with no updates .   .    Totally not worth buying this but i am fine with coz i have invested on it .   .   .   gets hanged sometimes and switches off by itself .   APPS are outdated .   .   .  
- The  was ok in the initial week .   However thereon the voice was always breaking in all calls .   But since it wasn't eligible for a return I'm now stuck with the  product .  
- I purchased and after one month battery backup remained only for 5 hours .   Under warranty it was replaced but after one year the same problem in new replaced  .    It seems this is the general problem in i 5s .  
- After using big display mobiles you may feel 4 inch display is too small .   Apart from this heating issue and uncomfortable to use apps not like android .  
- I had faced issues with this  it didn?t had the updated soft wares the  use to heat up while in use .  
- The charger plug provided was defectiveBut chose not to return it back since I would not have a  to use till the replacement happens .  
- There is problem in my i speaker is too low even can't hear  ring and when loud mic don't work .  
- It is becoming heat white charging and playing games with in 10 minutes .   Otherwise its good product .  
- gets heated up while charging or even calling for 10 minutes .   over priced
-  looks great but I can't merge calls that's the main drawback I faced till now .  
- Not great features as compared to value for money just a brand name to show off .  
- It is getting heated while charging and also while playing games .  
- I have changed my mind to purchase i 6 instead of i 5 .  
- repeated shut down issue within 20 days of purchase .  
- Performance ok but battery backup is not so good .  
- This  is defective but i have noticed it later as i have put the cover on this .   This is having is defective on the    upper right hand back side .   Even after  fully charged the battery goes to 10% in less than 12 hours .   It seems that this   i is not real one as there are multiple supplier of the s so the actual  supplier is not 100% genuine .  
- Purchased for my wife and she complains about network issues .   Battery life appears to be good with moderate use .  
- This is very disappointing that after purchasing Apple i 5s 16 GB getting a defective product .   It is totally waste   of time and money .   I want my money refunded  as early as possible because why a customer would suffer due to availability   of defective products .  
- Screen is just 4 inches and features are all 2013 based better go for Nexus 6 .   I'm regretting buying this dumb  and   just week after buying resell value is 50% .  
- I bought the  .   I was super pumped about it .   I unboxed it and put up the  for charging .   Day- 1 it was okay   second day i put the  for charging and it  was not charging at all .   I tried to switch ports thinking there might be   problem with my switch boards .   Still the  was not working .   I had to connect it to my  laptop using the cable .  
- i 5S is very good but it's little expensive n not value for money .  
- My i Bluetooth is not working I have checked week back I restarted and check still its not working .  
- defected product and not customer service against the same .  nobody is going to take follow up with me .  
- The  is getting extreme hot while charging .   On USB charging it doesn't precipitate so much heat .   Can any one of you   please suggest whether its normal or am I  having a faulty handset .   .   It is manufactured April 2015 .   Any advice or   solution would be of great help .   Thanks .   Rest everything its A OK .  
- I tried to activate the  but its dead its stuck on one screen and the most aweful part is that i had an emergency   the same day i received the  and had to  go out so i didn't activate it the same day now when i finally tried   activating it after around 2 weeks of receiving the  its dead and the refund period has  expired .

+ Trend setting  it's a delight to use this Started using this  right from the day one .  Music qualityvideo  quality is just top notch .  Camera is  excellent in dark .  
 retina display keeps you admiring the screen .  Apple may support this  for next 4 years as its 64bit architecture .    because the i 4s is also getting Ios 9 .    That's great from Apple to the customer who pay the extra premium .  I strongly  recommend this  to people who want to experience the awesomeness of Apple .  Think  Different ! !
+ Good product Easy to use and handling easyno hanging issueprice high but its worth ableonly one disadvantage that   after unlock only switch off the  this  option is not availabl
+ EXCELLENT  THIS  IS THE BEST .   THE TOUCH VIBRATION AND GRAPHICS ARE SO GOOD THAT YOU WOULD LOVE TO USE IT .  CAMERA  PLACES AN ADDED ADVANTAGE  .  THE PICS ARE SO  CLEAR THAT THE PIXELS CAN BE COMPARED TO 20 MP CAMERAS  .  FRONT CAMERA IS OF 1 .  2  MP BUT THE PICS ARE EXTRAORDINARY
+ Apple i 5S  i 5S can make anyone awestruck  .   Everyone should go for it but try buying the 32gb because now a   days 16gb isn't enough for us anymore .  
+ Superb  ! !  worth buying I am an Apple fan because of it's best hardware and software compatibility .   Though  specifications are not eye catching but those things  are just meant to fool the customers  .  It has an 8MP camera better  than 16 or 20MP of any other android  .    It has got just 1gb ram and a dual core processor but  u cannot find a small  lag in any of the high end games like Asphalt 8  real racing  injustice etc .   .  Even its front facetime hd camera (1 .  2 MP)  is much 2 better  than the 8 MP rear camera of many android s .  
 Speakers are damn cool as well .  If you use an i you will never regret it It's worth the money you invest?
+ Good  as always it's an i .   Go for it i fans :- )
+ This i 5s is getting heat very high when using internet .  I have purchased this i 5s Mobile usability and  product is really good but mobile is getting very  high level heating when using internet .

+ Very good Am very impressed with this  .   It has every feature that is required in modern times .   It has an  awesome camera .  It is very handy unlike the  i6 .   I recommend this to anyone looking for a smart less than Rs .    40000 as it is the best in that price range .  
+ Amazing Product .   .  Apple product as usual are value for money though I had issues initially as I switched my unflinching  loyalty to Apple from Nokia .   As of now I am  happy with the product it is user friendly simple and maintains its  exclusivity .   Application store contains all the important application that I wish and desire  for and unlike android all  application work seamless and flawless on the iOS .   Camera quality is superb and allow to take great shots .  
+ Awsome Product Trust me after using i you will feel the change .   Touch is super fine camera is excellent or else  what to say its the bitten APPLE thats quit  enough .  
+ Awesome Product Awesome product .   Reviewing this product after 6 month of use No flaws .   Super performance good battery .    Mainly great camera .   but costly .  
+ I Pone 5 S Gold Good Product but you gotta keep a close eye on price fluctuations .   My colleague bought it at Rs .  3k lesser  after I bought it .  
+ The Best  I personally find this  one of the best
+ Apple Apple Apple This is something that cannot be compared with other s in the market .   It creates a different  league for itself .   A dream  for every  android user .

+ Its an ART a Masterpiece  ! ! ! ! Always dreamed of getting i 5s for myself but variation in prices made me delay my  decision for a while .   Finally bought it  without a second thought .   About the product? what can i say "if you don't have  an i well you don't have an i " :- )

 It is an enjoyable ownership .  
+ sexy i the look is killer with gold and white combination .   it comes with latest 8 .  1 ios superb performance .   .   .   .  10/10  for camera .  
+ If you dont have an i Well you dont have an i Simply no words .   I had migrated from i to Android in 2011  and was amused by the capabilities of  android s .   now I am back to i and that was a real homecoming .   .   iOS has  class and i elevates it .   I dont know what I will do without the fingerprint  scanner that unlocks the   seamlessly .

+ Best I in the market Being an android purist I was skeptical to buy this  even if it was a gift for someone  else .   But this is one of the best i out  in the market with i 6 facing issues .   At the end of the day it does  the job expected from it and fulfills its role as a status symbol .  
+ Awesomeness ! ! ! !No doubt Apple is apple .   .  No competition ! ! ! Very good 
+ I 5S Review Product is Very good 
+ Amazing mobile available in the market .   I 5s is very quality effecient and comes with nice earpods .  64- bit  Architecture gives you fast and lagless experience .  
+ A Stable Gadget For a long time I was looking for a  which should not hang or give any trouble while usage and i  got it from The 5s .   I like the feature of  finger print reader as their is no way ur password gets disclosed .  Screen is  awesome camera is good but do'nt compare with dslr .   The gold finishing is just  awesome .  If you are putting a handsome  amount of money then i would prefer this .

PROS: Android feel like cheap Korean plastics .  CONS:  Ever heard cons with Apple?Experience the i 5S with it's A7 64- bit processor  and with it's motion co- processor it  packs a real power .   Battery lasts for about a day and a half .

+ Great Product No words to explain the fineness of the  .   Apple has really done its job extremely well .   Touch ID is totally awesome and fully useable .  
+ Awesome i Everyone was getting this i in GOLD but I decided against it and purchased the Grey version but lemme tell u  I am equally thrilled as I was  when I first held the Gold i .   Features and specs wise this  is definitely gr8
+ Great !"If you don't have an i means you don't have an i"
 Great piece of art .   The white Gold color is awesome .  
+ Great Camera and usual great user experience I am migrating from i 4 after keeping it for 3+  years .   The  is great and being on Apple ecosystem the migration  was simple .   
+ NEW GENERATION OF MOBILE !As there is no doubt in the built quality of this i will like to talk about its brand value the main reason why it is a little  costly .  As we all know Apple Inc .   the greatest company of techit offers a  that is beyond Samsung HTCSonyGioneeetc .  If we look at its camera it is 8 mp( 1 .  2  or 1 .  3 up) so the camera is very nice .   Processor is 1 .  2 dual core many might say it is only 1 .  2 dual core ! But remember it have apple A7 chip the best chip ever .   So  if u want to buy the best  then no doubt it is here .  
+ its a  not a phablet everything that it does .   .   .   it does it beautifully without a screen size of 5 and uncomfortable inches long
 it manages to fulfill your every need and still get in your pocket easily
+ ABOUT I PURCHASE NICE  WITH LOTS AND LOTS OF FUNCTIONS ACCESS TO USER COMPARE TO ANROID .  WISH IF APPLE KEEP PRICE A LIL BIT LOW .  SO THAT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD   IT .  
+ FANTASTIC  -  LOVE ITS DISPLAY / SPEED / PICTURE PHOTO QUALITY To Explore SIRI and Voice Calling etc .   would need some time but it is best for
 FACETIME (Live Calling) Best in Uploads etc than other s
+ Better Than The Best .   .   .   .  I would say one thing about Apple And Apple 5S Gold this is a very very best  and Outstanding Built Quality of this  .   .  Totally .   .   .     Better Product .   .  Only Apple  is the For that people are waiting for it and Que Can wait outside at apple store in India Also .   .   This is Apple Not any other Company  can do this thing .  
+ I am speechless  i can not say any thing .   .   .   .  wauuuuu What a product it is .   .   .   I can only say .   .   am speechless .   .   Everything really perfect .   .   .  
+ Great Product Apple i 5S is nice  .   New features are awesome
+ A fast processor excellent build quality and a great operating system It's fair to say that the i 5S isn't an improvement over the i 5 when it comes to  build quality because its predecessor was so well made .   In fact it's hard to see where Apple could improve .   In our opinion the i 5S is still the best looking  smart out there .   Its precision cut aluminum rear sits absolutely flush with glass panels that sit at the top and bottom .   Its neat beveled edges are perfectly  formed and the 7 .  3mm thick  feels incredibly comfortable in the hand .   Weighing just 112g which still feels almost impossibly light when you pick up the  smart for the first time the i 5S is still incredible to look at and hold
+ love i5sbest  love using itesy to use  no problemWell the i 5S is here  ! its the best i today 
+ amazing handset .   .   .   stunning looks I was stunned by this  .

Overall it is the best  in the market if u can afford it buy it ull never regret ur decision .   Apple keep on giving products  like this .   .   .   .  
+ nsalely great I 5S Awesomatic  ! ! ! Incomparable to any brand that literally exist now .   You own an I you own the most premium handset with state of the  art design .  
+ apple 5s is good looking apple 5s is good looking and apple 5s have finger print sensor lock is very useful to handling safe data .   
+ Unbeatable  at present market Simple yet powerful .   .   Awesome low light photography .   .   Smooth & fastest functionality .  
+ Awesome  Marvellous Hardware as well much better i experience ever .   .   .   Total cost experience also .   .   .  It's just awesome .   .   .  
+ AMAZING   ! ! ! ! The I 5s speak itself with the name it build in the market .   .   but after using this  i wold say that this is the amazing  i had ever  used  .   .   .   screen size is small compare to the market but practically this is the perfect screen size for use .   .  
+ Amazing  I can say that it's another master piece from Apple .   .  
 Before this I was using HTC One and to say I was very much satisfied with the  .  
 May be a bit expensive but I can say its value for money .   .  
+ The best  ever made People dont seem to understand but the is are the only  which give the smoothness and response expected of a 50k  .   All and  every Android  slows down which feels like a joke when you're paying so much money .   if you're in the market for high- end you need an i nothing else .  
+ Superb Mobile Of all Time ! ! Realy a very great product from Apple ! !Super mobile with good touch .   .  Feeling great with this mobile .   .  Had great facilities .   .   Easy to   use .   .  Great display ! !Wow ! ! !

+ i 5S Gold Best smart of 2013 .   Touch Id is a very convenient feature to have .  
+ Best i yet .  This is coming from an Apple fan but take it .   This is the best i Apple has ever made or the best  for that matter .   The color finish the  edges the quality of build is out of this world .   The software runs parallel to 64- bit processor and gives a different experience altogether than what iOS 7 on i  5 gives or any so called "powerful" quad- core processors .   TouchID is simple and quite fast for an HD sensor works flawlessly .   Camera with its slo- mo is amazing its  quite fun capturing the videos with slo- mo .   All in all its an amazing device and you should go for it .   
+ One of the best s ever The i 5S is a masterpiece of technology .   -  Camera is amazing and the pictures match a decent professional grade camera .   The Slo- Mo  and Burst modes work like charm- The Touch- Id is flawless .   It makes you pick up the  every- time and unlock it just for the sheer enjoyment of seeing the whole  technology work- The back panel is better than the i 5 and can hide scratches better (space- grey)
+ Best  !Charges Lightening Fast Speed Super Fast speed Great Looks .   Games are Mind- Blowing .   E- mail Messages and Facetime work like a charm .  
+ Best i yet i 5S gold is really amazing .   Fast processor good camera and beautiful design .   It also comes with the beautiful iOS 7 which is the best  operating system to iOS devices so far in my opinion .   I'm in love with this i !

+ Does i need a review i 5S at this price is definitely worth a buy .   Yes it's couple of years old .   However one can never go wrong with i .  
+ awesome product at this price range apple has made it affordable .   Ios platform better any any android .   But 16 gb rom and 1 gb ram may not prove adequate for too  much of pics or heavy space occupying games .  
+ Great i Very good i 5s 16gb and champagne gold colour  I really like it  new function finger touch I'd password and iOS 7 software 
+ Apple i 5s silver apple i 5s silver colour is so nice nd this colour is not in every one hand  .   So light weight nd their handling is not bad .
