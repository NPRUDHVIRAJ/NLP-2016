-Little Heavy, Mobile should light weighted. Those days gone when bulky phone is good.
-Outdated Think this is the model of 2010 when no one make touch screen and no one have those facility but now a days if  you spend 30K you will get far better and  Larger screen phone with all the features.
-Camara 8 MP when now u can get 13 to 20 MP in front and Front 5 MP. One thing should remember dont mix with 10k phone  price camara. You can't compare COW vs  Dog.Compare with Moto G, Lumia 730 atleast.
-Why maintenance is tooooo much costly. When u visit store for maintenance after warranty you are finished !!!
-Not a good product .I have purchased iphone 5s. But there is a problem with the mobile if i call someone i am hearing lot  of disturbance in the mobile but if i put  it in loudspeaker mode it working fine no issues
-Very Heat and not satisfied
-Camera and Torch Light does not work properly
-pathetic .very bad phone. i have used it for several months. most features bad. hangs very often. Battery is horrible.
-Very slow, low battery.It comes with iOS 9 or latest iOS, because of that you will feel lags while operating.. low  battery if you are on 3G
-Please do not buy this iPhone .I'm hugely disappointed with this iPhone as the battery hardly lasts an hour and also the  speaker sometimes makes strange noises
-Iphone 5S,The product turned out to have EXTREMELY/ABYSMALLY low battery life. I have to charge the same at least three  times a day and have to constantly carry a  power pack with me.
-not good. heating problem,less ram,less internal space,not a full hd display ,low resolution camera ,picture quality far  below from a digital camera screen size is  also less
-Charger quelty is poor .i have open box and put charge phone suddenly charge blast spark all wire of charge,phone is  removed from charger so Luke phone is safe but  charger lost. there is no any issue at my home wiring other phone charge  ok after that also
-Guys, be careful, this device doesn't support 4G though it is 5s.Our assumption is all iphone 5s does support 4G
-worst mobile ever only having good build quality.worst front camera when compared to xiaomi Mi4 ,u can compare it by  yourself..Only brand name that too going to  disappear soon due to so called 'nothing new' so called apple now....
-not worth the money...Go for iphone6 if u need an apple phone
-Worst Expericence .After 2 months of usage it started rebooting problem and suddenly got dead.
-Very worst scenario.The initial screen is flickering. The boot up is not working properly, it is not going to the next  step after the initial settings. I have tried  with multiple proper SIM cards, all were failed to launch the mobile. Very  worst scenario :( .Was this product not tested at all.... very very unfair, not at all  acceptable
-copy of samsung s4 and s3 micromaxcanvas knight is best than this micromax 350 cost just 9 k iphone 5 s very high cost   if u wait 1 more month it will be half of  this rate the rate when iphone released is 60 kand now it 20 k
-Apple repair service is very bad in India.My iPhone 5s having battery drain and excessive heating issue. And Apple is not  repairing it. Still it is in warranty.Every  time they ask me to factory reset my iphone. But it did not resolve it.
-Dont Buy This Phone... !! BEWARE !!very bad experience....!! worst phone ever...
 very slow processing speed.... camera quality is good but not up to the mark....!!front camera gives blury images....very  small screen
-Battery drain with in 4 hours of full charge and it heated up very fast 
-Installed only 3 apps so far and it hangs giving a very bad touch usage experience 
-Shit Phone From BULLSHIT APPLE Friends don't buy this bullshit phone.SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 is much much better than this  shit..Infact NOTE 2 have much more features  than this.AND IN LESS PRICE.............
-Pathetic battery.6 months later battery drains fully in 4 hours and phone heats up even when not used. not worth the  price paid
-bad experience Not working Freezing issue twice a day
-Worst experience, Purchased IPhone 5s 16 GB and found Microphone is not working
-Heating and battery drain issues full heating issue, even not able to hold the mobile during video call and battery  drained from 95% to 40% in 40 min video call
-S stands for Shit For this kind of money, I can buy the best stylus phone, more powerful and feature proof. It's  prehistoric icons, uncustomizable screens, paid  apps, non removable battery, lack of expandable memory are a dead turn  off.
-less battry back up and its getting heat very soon.I bought my iphone 5s, but am not satisfied with this, very less batry  back up and i dont knw its becoming too  heat if i play game for 5 mins.This is too pathetic..
-waste apple mobile .it is the waste phone ever.in the phone sensor only good .my phone apple finger print was sensor was  gone quikly so . the look is only good .  because of look and name of the company only it was getting by others. so dont  buy this phone.if we compair to moto g the moto g is good the price also perfect
-worst ,people are telling note 3 with all its massive specs as a shit becouse of its price. but this mobile with 16 gb  memory costs more than note 3 as good never  buy a apple phne
-Apple has been crazy but didn't think this bad....At this price i would get much much better phone like the note 3....  even the galaxy s4 is better than this even  though it is older, All flagship models of android OEMs are better than  this....
-FOOLS aND IDIOTS BUY aPPLE PHONES OTHERS BUY NOKIa , LG , OR KaRBONN. BEaCUSE SCREEN ND BaCK SIDE GETS BROKEN IF aNY  IPHONE FaLLS DOWN. NO aPPS, SMaLL PHONE FOR 40K.  NO USE FOR REGULR PHN USERS COS NTNG IN THIS PHONE LIKE aPPS , GOOD  BUILD OR ETC. BUY LUMIa OR LG G2
-WORST CELL PHONE OUT THERE SERVICE INCOMPETENT .he iPhone is horrible. They have incompetent service personnel, their  executive department has no authority to do  anything and EVERY update creates problems the phone did not previously have,  yet never fixes the KNOWN problems they acknowledge.
-The Apple UI is so hard to use, and the battery drains like there's no tomorrow, even on full charge. The only thing  that's good is the aesthetics. They probably   made the phone so thin, they couldn't fit in 1 gb of ram, and a decent  processor. You can't even expand the memory.At least you can get better processors, more RAM,  more storage space and expadability/connectivity options with Android phones.
-Overhyped, Overrated, Overpriced.Ok, I didn't buy this phone. It's a prize from a friend of mine. After comparing this phone to my Galaxy Note II, everything that  exists in this phone also exists in My Note II. Even my Note II have much more features. People say this is the best phone, but it's just a gimmick & hype. I can't  even customize the home screen like my Note II. The UI is as simple as usual, just a boring grid of icons . As you know, no widgets here, it's pretty boring for a  person who always want speed & ease like me. I don't want to open the mail app just for checking my email, it can be done faster & easier with widgets. The maps app  sucks, the map of my country isn't complete. Luckily I can download Google Maps from the app store. The signal & the speaker are weak. The proximity sensor behave  weirdly. G sensor is not sensitive. I can't transfer music via bluetooth. Why do you buy iphone if there are many smartphones that are better & cheaper than the  iphone?

-The phone heats up like anything. It's very dangerous flaw. When it starts getting heat up then it is  so hot that I get scared. Really disappointed with my purchase  as it seemed to be like a faulty product.
-Screen resolution not good compared to other iPhones.
-The body becomes hot and the phone hangs if i open any app. It has hanged more than 4 rimes in less than a month. Is it phones problem or software, because not  everyone is having the issue. The phone seems to be a defective piece sold online so that no one comes to know and the return is also tricky.

-The worst as ever. The iPhone 5s 16GB is getting heated like anything i ordered twice. The same problem persists both times. Don?t buy from cloudtail its worst. fully  disappointed.
-Poor product. The sleep or wake button is not working. I went to the imagine service center there they said they will replace a new mobile. It?s better to buy in  stores itself.
-overall I?m not happy with the product, started getting hanged and device gets heated up, went to service centre in first month itself.
-My experience is quite disheartening, At first I received a damaged instrument, The caller is not able to hear when I speak, I hv to put on th speaker or plug in th  earphone to speak, I didn?t want to exchange as there r experiences of others who did not receive the refund, I do not have the time either to pursue it either.

-I purchased i phone 5s in Sep'14. Now in Dec'14, it stopped working. This hangs at any time while it has more than 9 GB memory left. Now this completely switched off.  Don?t know why. Need to go service centre. I want to switch over to either HTC or Sony now.
-Very bad product, dint work good for one day also, it is now there in service centre .I wasted my valuable money on this piece, this is second time i have received  faulty item from amazon.
-I am using this product from 8 months, within 8 months device getting hang, Battery backup was worst, while doing charging device getting heat.
-My iPhone Bluetooth is not working I have checked week back I restarted and check still it?s not working.
-Really pathetic service, I got a faulty handset, I went to service centre but it won't accept by service people.
-I received this phone on the 24/5/2015. I was very excited but just after 3 days of usage the phone is overheating very quickly and in app sounds have just  disappeared. There is no volume in any of apps but the ringtone and everything are still working. It's overall a superb phone by apple but something faulty with the  retailer maybe. I would still recommend this phone but maybe not from Cloudtail.
-Received my iPhone 5s on Dec 21st. The upper part of the screen has the yellowish tint and also getting heated up on charging. Shown to the Apple service centre. I  did not expect such issues at all on the 1st day of 5s ownership. Will have to return the product if Apple service centre does not replace the handset.
-It?s been 28 hours I brought this iPhone 5s. Its get extremely hot while using browser and while charging as well.
-Facing issue with phone, keys are getting press automatically, feeling irritated auto switching to another pages here & there.
-Battery life is very disappointing. In 4G mode with minimal to no use, the battery would last for half a day. In 3G mode with minimal use it will last a day. I had  moved from Samsung because of its battery life but not a great move. Otherwise rest of the performance is satisfactory not super extraordinary. One thing which was  far better than Samsung was iPhone doesn't hang at all.
-can find a gap between the front screen n the aluminium body at the right top corner of iPhone 5s tat i purchased 2 days back is it normal. When pressed the screen it  flexes in. Will anything happen to it in future. 
-didn't like the iPhone 5S as a product... there are no improvement on camera side when we compare to 4S. I would like to return this phone to amazon and by any good  android phone for my personal use. Please let me know how I can return this product even I crossed the no of days as written in return policy.
-Total waste of money. Amazon sold me a defective piece wherein the phone is getting hung since the first day. I need a replacement at the earliest with the original  phone. 
-As i got my phone 3 days back I?m facing problem with the camera. There is a wave like line on screen when using camera in video mode.
-Phone gets heated too much.
-Phone is working fine, but the lock button is wobbly, even the volume buttons are pretty loose too.
-Battery backup is very less and the phone overheats frequently even if it is in sleep.
-It is not operating friendly and phone gets continue hanged with the update of ios8.
-Very very small battery life and Internet not working only 1715 mah battery.
-Charger and phone both are heating up and apple support is not able to figure out. I am working with them and hoping that they will provide the solution but at this  point, I am not happy with it as you don't want this after spending so much money.
-I am not happy with the performance.it frequently getting hanged which is very unusual in iPhone. Screen gets blurred at least twice every day. I need to restart  every time it happens. I doubt the genuinity of the product I received.
-In was expecting a phone worth of 35K not having issues like touch screen issue, delay in response time etc. really disappointed with the phone and with seller.
-This phone used to get heated very quickly and more over the voice quality isn't that great.
-There was a signal issue with this phone, like anywhere i was irrespective of inside or outdoor, I had only 3 dots and it never went full anytime, I tested this for  3-4 days. Then when I took it to the service station they told it?s better to return it. Then I did so.
-IPhone 5s is outdated as compare to its competitor. it?s not good as per todays gadgets. guys buy some other phone.
-The item is not upto the mark. I used a moto g 1st gen mobile which i feel had a greater signal (Wi-Fi or mobile network) reception than this iPhone. This also heats  up fast when charging. The battery backup is pathetic. Sometimes the music stops in between and you need to restart the phone to trigger it again. I wonder if this is  a new iPhone or a refurbished one.
-After working fine for few days. Phone started to hang on to camera app. WhatsApp is not working smoothly pics are taking too much time and uploading getting failed  also. Something is wrong. Talked to Amazon customer care.. As now 10 days are over so I need to visit apple store. Hopefully they will the accept product as genuine  and do the needful.
-Nothing can match android. Bit disappointed with the phone.. Anybody planning to buy this there are many other options in android. Apps are very old with no updates..  Totally not worth buying this but i am fine with coz i have invested on it...phone gets hanged sometimes and switches off by itself. APPS are outdated...
-The phone was ok in the initial week. However thereon the voice was always breaking in all calls. But since it wasn't eligible for a return, I'm now stuck with the  product.
-I purchased and after one month battery backup remained only for 5 hours. Under warranty it was replaced but after one year, the same problem in new replaced phone.  It seems this is the general problem in iPhone 5s.
-After using big display mobiles, you may feel 4 inch display is too small. Apart from this, heating issue and uncomfortable to use apps, not like android.
-I had faced issues with this phone, it didn?t had the updated soft wares, the phone use to heat up while in use.
-The charger plug provided was defectiveBut chose not to return it back since I would not have a phone to use till the replacement happens.
-There is problem in my iPhone speaker is too low even can't hear phone ring and when loud mic don't work.
-It is becoming heat white charging and playing games with in 10 minutes. Otherwise its good product.
-gets heated up while charging or even calling for 10 minutes. over priced
-Phone looks great, but I can't merge calls that's the main drawback I faced till now.
-Not great features as compared to value for money just a brand name to show off.
-It is getting heated while charging and also while playing games.
-I have changed my mind to purchase iPhone 6 instead of iPhone 5.
-repeated shut down issue within 20 days of purchase.
-Performance ok but battery backup is not so good.
-This phone is defective but i have noticed it later as i have put the cover on this. This is having is defective on the    upper right hand back side. Even after  fully charged the battery goes to 10% in less than 12 hours. It seems that this   iPhone is not real one as there are multiple supplier of the phones so the actual  supplier is not 100% genuine.
-Purchased for my wife, and she complains about network issues. Battery life appears to be good with moderate use.
-This is very disappointing that after purchasing Apple iPhone 5s 16 GB getting a defective product. It is totally waste   of time and money. I want my money refunded  as early as possible because why a customer would suffer due to availability   of defective products.
-Screen is just 4 inches and features are all 2013 based better go for Nexus 6. I'm regretting buying this dumb phone and   just week after buying resell value is 50%.
-I bought the phone. I was super pumped about it. I unboxed it and put up the phone for charging. Day-1 it was okay,   second day i put the phone for charging and it  was not charging at all. I tried to switch ports thinking there might be   problem with my switch boards. Still, the phone was not working. I had to connect it to my  laptop using the cable.
-iPhone 5S is very good but it's little expensive n not value for money.
-My iPhone Bluetooth is not working I have checked week back I restarted and check still its not working.
-defected product and not customer service against the same.nobody is going to take follow up with me.
-The phone is getting extreme hot while charging. On USB charging it doesn't precipitate so much heat. Can any one of you   please suggest whether its normal or am I  having a faulty handset.. It is manufactured April 2015. Any advice or   solution would be of great help. Thanks. Rest everything its A OK.
-I tried to activate the phone but its dead, its stuck on one screen and the most aweful part is that i had an emergency   the same day i received the phone and had to  go out so i didn't activate it the same day, now when i finally tried   activating it after around 2 weeks of receiving the phone, its dead and the refund period has  expired.

+Good phone excellent phone. no lag, upgarde to newer IOS.Camera is awesome.Music excellent. Extra smooth
+Best Smartphone in the market at best price This is a must buy at the moment and will satisfy all your needs with a  smartphone. It really doesn't advertise its  entire features through internet. But it is a worth buy for 21k. Main  features are its quick charging battery, easy to use UI and OS, High definition camera, Unique  Slow Motion video  capturing, Free Apps, Photo sharing apps, etc. And owing an iPhone inculcates a proud feeling among its users. And grab  this opportunity, when its  prices are slashed. Good luck.
+Best iPhone at a great price A great and original product at a great price - Recommended for buying iPhone 5s - Thanks
+Absolutely gorgeous I have been using Apple products since last 5 years, iPod Touch, iPad mini 2, Apple iPhone 4 and now  the iPhone 5s. I have always been a fan of  the quality of their products.  ios 9.1 pre installed. I updated it to ios  9.2. Checked the warranty on the Apple support site 
+amazing performance iPhone 5s Hard to complaint about this device, amazing powerful performance in small package.camera  is too good both front and rear. Battery is  also good. Don't compare with numbers ie.1570 mah. Display can be smaller for  some people. If u can use it with this screen size then it's perfect phone at this  price

+Its an old phone but it still rocks !Its an old phone but it still rocks, I guess that why iproducts are good and I will  continue to use until it dies.
+Awesome phone for lower price Awesome phone, Apple always make best phones. The compatibility between hardware and  software in iPhones is superb which lacks in  android. Specs compassion doesn't make any sense. The simplicity in iPhones  are really cool. Apple don't build big features but really makes the smart features which  is really useful in real time  usage. The battery life is awesome. The finger printer sensor is really helpful. Camera is really nice. Build quality is  superb.
+Nice phone Nice machine . I was using Android from past 4-5 years but ISO is really great. Processing is very fast.
+Great phone to buy.....I have used many Android phones and also used IPhone 5S. And i have found that smoothness and  performance is far better then Android phones.  UI performance and gaming performance is excellent. It doesn't matter how  much ram IPhone has, its amazing to use. Just go for it.
+Very Nice For Lite Uses...Its a very nice phone for those who use their phone with very calm mood...Baterry is not good  as andriod but good for mix uses.For rough  uses you should go for andriod because iphone not gives you freedom as  andriod.
+excellent i was worried reading previous reviews but i am completely satisfies with the quality of the product.
+Excellent Product It has superb cameras and efficiency of speakers are higher than that of Android phones. TouchID is  working nice except when the fingers are sweaty  and it is resists shocks nicely. Its size is very handy to use.

+Awesome !!!This is my first apple product and i am very much satisfied with the Phone and the iOS ecosystem !!!The iOS is  amazing with absolutely no lags !!!!! The  Finger print scanner is amazing and detects fast. The Apple A7 Processor is  blazing fast and is almost equal to Snapdragon 801.
+Iphone 5sOne of the best phone i have ever used.Only appreciation for the phone no complaints.Best in camera as compared   to other phones specially Samsung,HTC and  Sony.....I am very happy by the performence really like the phone sorry my  iphone?..
+Worth ItMobiles were meant to fit in palms and this one does that and performs like a powerhouse as well.The finish of  the phone is excellent and it if far better  than 95% of mobiles in the market.

+Great full to use iPhone 5SData access is extremely highHappy to use itImproves my status in the society.I feel like I  become a iPhone familyBrand is always a brandI  LOVE U MY DEAR 'iPhone'
+Trend setting phone, it's a delight to use this phoneStarted using this phone right from the day one.Music quality,video  quality is just top notch.Camera is  excellent in dark.
 retina display keeps you admiring the screen.Apple may support this phone for next 4 years as its 64bit architecture.  because the iphone 4s is also getting Ios 9.  That's great from Apple to the customer who pay the extra premium.I strongly  recommend this phone to people who want to experience the awesomeness of Apple.Think  Different!!
+Good product Easy to use and handling easy,no hanging issue,price high but its worth ableonly one disadvantage that phone  after unlock only switch off the phone this  option is not availabl
+EXCELLENT PHONE THIS PHONE IS THE BEST. THE TOUCH VIBRATION AND GRAPHICS ARE SO GOOD THAT YOU WOULD LOVE TO USE IT.CAMERA  PLACES AN ADDED ADVANTAGE .THE PICS ARE SO  CLEAR THAT THE PIXELS CAN BE COMPARED TO 20 MP CAMERAS .FRONT CAMERA IS OF 1.2  MP BUT THE PICS ARE EXTRAORDINARY
+Apple iPhone 5S  iPhone 5S can make anyone awestruck . Everyone should go for it, but try buying the 32gb because now a   days 16gb isn't enough for us anymore.
+Superb phone!! , worth buying I am an Apple fan because of it's best hardware and software compatibility. Though  specifications are not eye catching but those things  are just meant to fool the customers .It has an 8MP camera better  than 16 or 20MP of any other android phone.  It has got just 1gb ram and a dual core processor but  u cannot find a small  lag in any of the high end games like Asphalt 8 , real racing , injustice etc..Even its front facetime hd camera (1.2 MP)  is much 2 better  than the 8 MP rear camera of many android phones.
 Speakers are damn cool as well.If you use an iPhone you will never regret it, It's worth the money you invest?
+Good phone as always it's an iphone. Go for it iphone fans :-)
+This iphone 5s is getting heat very high when using internet.I have purchased this iphone 5s, Mobile usability and  product is really good but mobile is getting very  high level heating when using internet.
+superb phone all apple products match upto their name of quality and seamlessness if you are apple user you will  understand what i am trying to say.
+Very good phoneAm very impressed with this phone. It has every feature that is required in modern times. It has an  awesome camera.It is very handy unlike the  iphone6. I recommend this to anyone looking for a smartphone less than Rs.  40,000 as it is the best in that price range.
+Amazing Product..Apple product as usual are value for money, though I had issues initially as I switched my unflinching  loyalty to Apple from Nokia. As of now I am  happy with the product, it is user friendly, simple and maintains its  exclusivity. Application store contains all the important application that I wish and desire  for and unlike android all  application work seamless and flawless on the iOS. Camera quality is superb and allow to take great shots.
+Awsome Product Trust me after using iPhone you will feel the change. Touch is super fine, camera is excellent or else  what to say its the bitten APPLE thats quit  enough.
+Awesome Product Awesome product. Reviewing this product after 6 month of use, No flaws. Super performance, good battery.  Mainly great camera. but costly.
+I Pone 5 S Gold Good Product but you gotta keep a close eye on price fluctuations. My colleague bought it at Rs.3k lesser  after I bought it.
+The Best Phone I personally find this phone one of the best
+Apple Apple Apple This is something that cannot be compared with other phones in the market. It creates a different  league for itself. A dream phone for every  android user.

+Its an ART, a Masterpiece !!!! Always dreamed of getting iphone 5s for myself, but variation in prices made me delay my  decision for a while. Finally bought it  without a second thought. About the product? what can i say, "if you don't have  an iphone, well you don't have an iphone " :-)
+Great deviceGreat mobile... just a great one..You will fall n love with Apple :-) I am using from past 1 months, no  problem at all..no hanging issues..heating  issues..whatsoever.. :-)

 It is an enjoyable ownership.
+sexy iphone the look is killer with gold and white combination. it comes with latest 8.1 ios superb performance....10/10  for camera.
+If you dont have an iPhone, Well, you dont have an iPhone Simply no words. I had migrated from iphone to Android in 2011  and was amused by the capabilities of  android phones. now, I am back to iPhone, and that was a real homecoming.. iOS has  class, and iphone elevates it. I dont know what I will do without the fingerprint  scanner that unlocks the phone  seamlessly.
+Iphone is Best When it comes to product review nothing to say its apple product says everything.much less laggy than my  previous android samsung galaxy s4
+nice and good qaualityi phone 5sgood quality phonebattery life is so good
+Best Iphone in the market Being an android purist, I was skeptical to buy this phone, even if it was a gift for someone  else. But this is one of the best iphone out  in the market with iphone 6 facing issues. At the end of the day, it does  the job expected from it and fulfills its role as a status symbol.
+Awesomeness!!!!No doubt Apple is apple..No competition!!! Very good 
+IPHONE 5S Review Product is Very good 
+Amazing mobile available in the market. Iphone 5s is very quality effecient and comes with nice earpods.64-bit  Architecture gives you fast and lagless experience.
+A Stable Gadget For a long time I was looking for a phone which should not hang or give any trouble while usage, and i  got it from The 5s. I like the feature of  finger print reader as their is no way ur password gets disclosed.Screen is  awesome, camera is good but do'nt compare with dslr. The gold finishing is just  awesome.If you are putting a handsome  amount of money then i would prefer this.
+Wonderful Phone... Became an Apple fan after buying this productAwesome build quality, unmatched quality, OS. Feels rich  in your hand. Never Hangs.Pics are amazing..  I can keep on telling pros about this product.
+Apple is Awesome People can go on with their blah blah blah about iPhones, that its high in price and whatever. The truth  is if people can't buy it, they will  criticize it! I have used Apple iPhone 3GS, 4S and now I am using 5S. And I just  want to say: iPhones are the best. Be it camera, display, speed, smoothness or  anything. Every thing is great about Apple  phones. It can only be rated with 5 stars. I LOVE IPHONES!!
+Best phone ever fully satisfied with the product. People keep criticizing apple but really there is no match of Iphone  with any other android phone. You have to use  it to belive it

+Its Apple. What more can I say? Best in quality. Although thespecs could've been better for the price, the quality of the  product
+Good One I had a great experience by using this. Camera, performance...all over its a good phone. Screen size compared to  any other adroid, its less. But its a good  choice for MNC peoples or business peoples. And the phone is too weightless.
+Awesome simply one word discription its awesome.... many may be arguing abt the features thatandroid phones r providing  at the same or less price.... but its the  performance thats count rather than the features... go for it

+Apple you rock........one word for iPhone 5s is Awesome.
+You do not need to think twice if you want to go for an iPhone They're toying with the price everywhere right now even  after the release of iPhone 6. If you can't  afford iPhone 6, 6s go for this then. Looks quite premium and suits my needs  so no complains there.
+Ha.......Does this needs a review??......... :)Comon........its the APPLE.....THEY WERE THE BEST...........THEY ARE THE  BEST...AND.THEY WILL BE THE BEST............
 Some people compare iphone with Samsung Galaxy line, Sony Xperia line of smartphones. They must understand that APPLE IS  BEYOND COMPARE.......

+Awasome King of Phones "iPhone"Frequently last 2 years i am using iPhone5, iPhone is the best phone available in the  market. And it purely defines its tag line "If  you don't have an iPhone, You don't have an iPhone".Best phone forever,  value for money, good for life will help to understand money is does matter when you have  good phone .... :)

+ya u can its a weigthless device with good features.... as it cums wd dis devce u must go thru its apps.. fabulus wrk out  there... design(outer luk)
+If you don't own an iPhone. You don't own an iPhone.Unless you've experienced this masterpiece from Apple. And trust me  you wouldn't even need to read anything  before you buy. So, just buy.PROS: Android feel like cheap Korean plastics.CONS:  Ever heard cons with Apple?Experience the iPhone 5S with it's A7 64-bit processor  and with it's motion co-processor it  packs a real power. Battery lasts for about a day and a half.

+Great Product No words to explain the fineness of the phone. Apple has really done its job extremely well. Touch ID is totally awesome and fully useable.
+Awesome iPhone Everyone was getting this iPhone in GOLD, but I decided against it and purchased the Grey version, but lemme tell u , I am equally thrilled as I was  when I first held the Gold iPhone. Features and specs wise this phone is definitely gr8
+Great!"If you don't have an iPhone, means you don't have an iPhone"
 Great piece of art. The white Gold color is awesome.
+Great Camera and usual great user experience I am migrating from iPhone 4 after keeping it for 3+ years. The phone is great and being on Apple ecosystem the migration  was simple. 
+NEW GENERATION OF MOBILE!As there is no doubt in the built quality of this phone,i will like to talk about its brand value the main reason why it is a little  costly.As we all know Apple Inc. the greatest company of tech,it offers a phone that is beyond Samsung, HTC,Sony,Gionee,etc.If we look at its camera it is 8 mp( 1.2  or 1.3 up) so the camera is very nice. Processor is 1.2 dual core many might say it is only 1.2 dual core! But remember it have apple A7 chip the best chip ever. So  if u want to buy the best phone then no doubt it is here.
+its a phone not a phablet everything that it does... it does it beautifully without a screen size of 5 and uncomfortable inches long
 it manages to fulfill your every need and still get in your pocket easily

 FACETIME (Live Calling) Best in Uploads etc than other phones

+I am speechless , i can not say any thing....wauuuuu What a product it is... I can only say.. am speechless.. Everything really perfect...
+Great Product Apple iPhone 5S is nice phone. New features are awesome
+A fast processor, excellent build quality and a great operating system It's fair to say that the iPhone 5S isn't an improvement over the iPhone 5 when it comes to  build quality, because its predecessor was so well made. In fact, it's hard to see where Apple could improve. In our opinion, the iPhone 5S is still the best looking  smartphone out there. Its precision cut aluminum rear sits absolutely flush with glass panels that sit at the top and bottom. Its neat beveled edges are perfectly  formed and the 7.3mm thick phone feels incredibly comfortable in the hand. Weighing just 112g, which still feels almost impossibly light when you pick up the  smartphone for the first time, the iPhone 5S is still incredible to look at and hold
+love iPhone5sbest phone ,love using it,esy to use , no problemWell the iPhone 5S is here ! its the best iPhone today 
+amazing handset... stunning looks I was stunned by this phone. Great looks, fantastic build quality, stunning display, blazing fast, outstanding camera and excellent  finger print reader in home button. Overall it is the best phone in the market, if u can afford it buy it ull never regret ur decision. Apple keep on giving products  like this....
+nsalely great IPhone 5S Awesomatic phone!!! Incomparable to any brand that literally exist now. You own an IPhone, you own the most premium handset with state of the  art design.
+apple 5s is good looking apple 5s is good looking and apple 5s have finger print sensor lock is very useful to handling safe data. 
+Unbeatable phone at present market Simple yet powerful.. Awesome low light photography.. Smooth & fastest functionality.
+Awesome Phone Marvellous Hardware, as well much better iPhone experience ever... Total cost experience also...It's just awesome...
+AMAZING PHONE !!!! The Iphone 5s speak itself with the name it build in the market.. but after using this phone i wold say that this is the amazing phone i had ever  used ... screen size is small compare to the market but practically this is the perfect screen size for use..
+Amazing Phone I can say that it's another master piece from Apple..
 Before this I was using HTC One, and to say I was very much satisfied with the phone.
 May be a bit expensive but I can say its value for money..
+The best phone ever made People dont seem to understand but the iPhones are the only phone which give the smoothness and response expected of a 50k phone. All and  every Android phone slows down which feels like a joke when you're paying so much money. if you're in the market for high-end, you need an iPhone, nothing else.
+Superb Mobile Of all Time!! Realy a very great product from Apple!!Super mobile with good touch..Feeling great with this mobile..Had great facilities.. Easy to   use..Great display!!Wow!!!
+Awesome The phone is just awesome.. the touch id works flawless .
+iphone 5s very good product, stylish , classy iphone 5s. its champagne gold not gold..that looks very good.experience of having apple products is awesome.
+iPhone 5S Gold Best smartphone of 2013. Touch Id is a very convenient feature to have.
+Best iPhone, yet.This is coming from an Apple fan but take it. This is the best iPhone, Apple has ever made or the best phone for that matter. The color finish, the  edges, the quality of build is out of this world. The software runs parallel to 64-bit processor and gives a different experience altogether than what iOS 7 on iPhone  5 gives or any so called "powerful" quad-core processors. TouchID is simple and quite fast for an HD sensor, works flawlessly. Camera with its slo-mo is amazing, its  quite fun capturing the videos with slo-mo. All in all, its an amazing device and you should go for it. 
+One of the best phones ever The iPhone 5S is a masterpiece of technology. - Camera is amazing and the pictures match a decent professional grade camera. The Slo-Mo  and Burst modes work like charm-The Touch-Id is flawless. It makes you pick up the phone every-time and unlock it just for the sheer enjoyment of seeing the whole  technology work-The back panel is better than the iPhone 5 and can hide scratches better (space-grey)
+Best Phone!Charges Lightening Fast Speed, Super Fast speed, Great Looks. Games are Mind-Blowing. E-mail, Messages and Facetime work like a charm.
+Best iPhone yet iPhone 5S gold is really amazing. Fast processor, good camera, and beautiful design. It also comes with the beautiful iOS 7 which is the best  operating system to iOS devices so far, in my opinion. I'm in love with this iPhone!
+It is time to buy It is awesome phone. Size of the phone is perfect. Fits into the shirt packet, friendly for the hand to hold. screen clarity is excellent. It is 40%  of price to 6s, but has more than 90% of its features.
+Does iPhone need a review iPhone 5S at this price is definitely worth a buy. Yes it's couple of years old. However one can never go wrong with iPhone.
+awesome product at this price range, apple has made it affordable. Ios platform better any any android. But 16 gb rom and 1 gb ram, may not prove adequate for too  much of pics or heavy space occupying games.
+Great iphone Very good iphone 5s 16gb and champagne gold colour , I really like it , new function finger touch I'd password and iOS 7 software 
+Apple iphone 5s silver apple iphone 5s silver colour is so nice nd this colour is not in every one hand . So light weight nd their handling is not bad.

In every model of apple iphone only 5s is  so perfect in every thing. No one to compette the apple iphone in the market nd their looks sooooo nice i love it
+Excellent Phone But Priced A Bit High Apple iOS 7 Touch Screen (Capacitive) Display Type: Retina display, Scratch resistant Three-axis gyro, Accelerometer, Proximity,  Ambient Light, Fingerprint identity sensor (Touch ID) Noise...

So, if you are having a thought then make it a purchase.
+Another amazing product from Apple I was about to buy iphone 6 but then I searched a little and came to know that iphone 6 is not really a big upgrade to iphone 5s.  If you wish to buy iphone 6 better wait for the next variant. This 32 gig variant is available at a stealing price on SD. I feel it's better to go for 32 gig iphone  5s instead of iphone 6.
